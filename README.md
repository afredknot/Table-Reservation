## Description

The goal of this project was to build a database that allows for users to reserve tables within a restaurant by clicking on a graphical representation of the store front. This allows them to choose where in the restaurant  they wish to sit with much greater accuracy. The insiration lay in hoping to avoid normal irritants in a restaurant such as sitting near the kitchen or the door in winter. This project taught our group the importance of database relationships, data handling, proper implementation of routes/fetch calls, as well as, conditional styling and rendering.

First, sign in and create a profile. Then, use the search bar to find restaurants within the databse. After selecting one, then choose a table from the graphic representation of the floorplan of the restaurant. Finally, select the number of persons in your "group".  You can then look up your reservations at your profile, found in the hamburger button on the right of the page
