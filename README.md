## Description

The goal of this project was to build a database that allows for users to reserve tables within a restaurant by clicking on a graphical representation of the store front. This allows them to choose where in the restaurant they wish to sit with much greater accuracy. The inspiration lay in hoping to avoid normal irritants in a restaurant such as sitting near the kitchen or the door in winter. This project taught our group the importance of database relationships, data handling, proper implementation of routes/fetch calls, consistent styling and rendering.

## Installation

As a deployed website, nothing. Merely follow the link.
Running from your local machine will require you to install the node packages, run the schema, and seed the database before use.

## Usage

First, sign in and create a profile. Then, use the search bar to find restaurants within the database. With limited restaurant options included, try 'taco', 'pizza', or 'burgers' After selecting one, then choose a table from the graphic representation of the floorplan of the restaurant. Finally, select the number of persons in your "group".  You can then look up your reservations at your profile, found in the hamburger button on the right of the page
 
## Contriubtion Guidelines
 
As a school project, there is always much room for refinement. Should someone want to, they are welcome to clone it down from github, or contact the contributors through github.
Adding date/time selection functionality, deleting reservations, and adding the ability to create a list of a user's favorite tables are all features we have considered implementing.
